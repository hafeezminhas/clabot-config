# Contributor's Licence Agreement

The OpenCDMS Project is managed by a non-profit organisation called the [OpenWIS Association](https://openwis.io).

Before we can merge contributions of code and documentation, we need developers to agree to a Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA):
- If you work for a organisation, the CLA form should be completed by an authorised member of the organisation. Multiple employees can be listed on the same form.
- Contributors who are working in their own time, outside of the scope of their usual employment, may still need consent from their employer that any intellectual property they contribute can be share with the project.
- In addition to the considerations above, please review the full details at the [OpenWIS Assocation website](http://openwis.github.io/openwis-documentation/rules/A-contributor-license-agreement.html).

The Contributor's Licence Agreement form can be downloaded/printed [here](http://openwis.github.io/openwis-documentation/static/CLA/CLAform.html).
<!--You can see an [example of the completed form here](https://github.com/opencdms/clabot-config/blob/main/openwis_association_cla_example.pdf).-->

## Technical information

This repository is used by [cla-bot](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/) to automatically check that contributors have agreed to the Contributor's Licence Agreement by ensuring that their GitHub user ID is recorded in the [.clabot file](https://github.com/opencdms/clabot-config/blob/main/.clabot).
